# SON-GKEEPER
This is [SONATA](http://www.sonata-nfv.eu)'s Service Platform Gatekeeper's repository.

The Gatekeeper is the component that implements all the **Northbound Interface** (NBI) of the Servive Platform.
 
This NBI provides systems like the [son-push](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-push), [son-gui](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gui) and [son-bss](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-bss) access to the **Service Platform**, for features like:

 * **accepting new developers**' to be part of the contributors of new developed services;
 * **accepting new services** to be deployed in the platform;
 * **accepting new service instance requests** from customers interested in instantiating a service;
 * etc..

# Repository organization
This repository is organized by **micro-service**.

Micro-services currently implemented are the following:

1. [`son-gtkapi`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkapi): the only 'door' to the Gatekeeper, where the API is exposed;
1. [`son-gtkpkg`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkpkg): where all Packages features are implemented;
1. [`son-gtksrv`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtksrv): where all Services features are implemented;
1. [`son-gtkvim`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkvim): where all Vims features are implemented;

The remaining micro-services ([`son-gtkusr`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkusr), [`son-gtklic`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtklic) and [`son-gtkkpi`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkkpi), and eventually others), will be implemented in the course of the project.
